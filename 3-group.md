ACTIVITIES
1. HAproxy uses, what it is? with help of google
2. Test roundrobin in order to change the percentage of request per server
3. We used sed with append, with the flag i and \a append and \s for replace \g replace phrase everywhere #i for put inside a specific line
4. We did some exercises of function bash and how it receives parameters
5. We discussed how works SSL and the HTTP protocol
6. we delete some rules in the firewall using sudo ufw delete number, and sudo ufw status numbered
7. made some exercises with awk 
8. difference between 22 and 22/tcp is that 22 allow tcp and udp but 22/tcp only allow the tcp protocol
9. flag -f erase and create in ln command
10. tgz file compresed, is commomnly used on unix and linux systems
11. ; and  ´ ´ for run process in a continue form
12. for each env.host the entire script is going to run
13. do the excersise peak python

BOTTLENECKS
Understand the relation of SSL certificates and HTTP protocol

CONCLUSION
We always need to check the ports in every configuration and mantain secure the configurations
